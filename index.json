My lovely target organisms are cyanobacteria. They perform oxygen-evolving photosynthesis using two photosystems, photosystem I and photosystem II. The name of cyanobacteria comes from their \u0026ldquo;blue-green\u0026rdquo; color. But cyanobacteria are more colorful, not only the blue-green but also red, purple, pink and more. The color palette is thanks to their major antenna protein complex \u0026ldquo;phycobilisome\u0026rdquo;. Phycobilisome is composed of many colorful chromophore-binding proteins, phycobiliproteins, and their associated linker proteins. The typical phycobilisome consists of several peripheral rods radially projected from a core. A rod-core linker protein CpcG anchors the rod to the core.\nOptimization of the photosynthesis is vital for photosynthetic organisms to survive a continually changing environment. Re-organization of light-harvesting antenna systems and photosystems is the primary way for that. Previously, I discovered a novel supercomplex of the photosystem I and a specific phycobilisome, CpcL-phycobilisome, from Anabaena sp. PCC 7120. CpcL-phycobilisome is a rod-type phycobilisome that lacks the core components. It is directly connected with the photosystem I specifically by a linker protein CpcL to form a Phycobilisome-CpcL-Photosystem I supercomplex. Both the typical phycobilisome and the CpcL-phycobilisome can transfer the energy to photosystem I. However, how the cells control the two different types of phycobilisome remains elusive. I aim to reveal the molecular mechanisms of how environmental input can affect the organization of the two distinct phycobilisomes. And also, I want to uncover what is the difference in the physiological roles of the two phycobilisomes as the photosystem I antenna.\n","date":1579824000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579824000,"objectID":"5c724fccced683e56e6b828bbed3daf4","permalink":"https://.github.io/project/light-signaling/","publishdate":"2020-01-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/light-signaling/","section":"project","summary":"How cyanobacteria coordinate the two types of antenna for photosystem I?","tags":[""],"title":"Supercomplex of photosystem and antenna —organization and function—","type":"project"},{"authors":["Mai Watanabe"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1563926400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563926400,"objectID":"7f1ec0e30fab45850d880de832ed75e0","permalink":"https://.github.io/post/001-helloworld/","publishdate":"2019-07-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/001-helloworld/","section":"post","summary":"Hello World!","tags":[""],"title":"Launched my personal website.","type":"post"},{"authors":["Yuu Hirose","Song Chihong","**Mai Watanabe**","Chinatsu Yonekawa","Kazuyoshi Murata","Masahiko Ikeuchi","Toshihiko Eki"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"a61d91154b2ff7c17b7adc91b50b6feb","permalink":"https://.github.io/publication/hirose-2019-diverse/","publishdate":"2019-09-20T13:47:22.592167Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hirose-2019-diverse/","section":"publication","summary":"Cyanobacteria have evolved various photoacclimation processes to perform oxygenic photosynthesis under different light environments. Chromatic acclimation (CA) is a widely recognized and ecologically important type of photoacclimation, whereby cyanobacteria alter the absorbing light colors of a supermolecular antenna complex called the phycobilisome. To date, several CA variants that regulate the green-absorbing phycoerythrin (PE) and/or the red-absorbing phycocyanin (PC) within the hemi-discoidal form of phycobilisome have been characterized. In this study, we identified a unique CA regulatory gene cluster encoding yellow–green-absorbing phycoerythrocyanin (PEC) and a rod-membrane linker protein (CpcL) for the rod-shaped form of phycobilisome. Using the cyanobacterium *Leptolyngbya* sp. PCC 6406, we revealed novel CA variants regulating PEC (CA7) and the rod-shaped phycobilisome (CA0), which maximize yellow–green light-harvesting capacity and balance the excitation of photosystems, respectively. Analysis of the distribution of CA gene clusters in 445 cyanobacteria genomes revealed eight CA variants responding to green and red light, which are classified based on the presence of PEC, PE, *cpcL*, and CA photosensor genes. Phylogenetic analysis further suggested that the emergence of CA7 was a single event and preceded that of heterocystous strains, whereas the acquisition of CA0 occurred multiple times. Taken together, these results offer novel insights into the diversity and evolution of the complex cyanobacterial photoacclimation mechanisms.","tags":[""],"title":"Diverse Chromatic Acclimation Processes Regulating Phycoerythrocyanin and Rod-Shaped Phycobilisome in Cyanobacteria","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Koji Kato","Ryo Nagao","Tian-Yi Jiang","Yoshifumi Ueno","Makio Yokono","Siu Kit Chan","**Mai Watanabe**","Masahiko Ikeuchi","Jian-Ren Shen","Seiji Akimoto","Naoyuki Miyazaki","Fusamichi Akita"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"82677db1952c53d8a8c2a73c58633f6a","permalink":"https://.github.io/publication/kato-2019-psi-tetramer-structure/","publishdate":"2019-10-30T13:47:22.592167Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kato-2019-psi-tetramer-structure/","section":"publication","summary":"Photosystem I (PSI) functions to harvest light energy for conversion into chemical energy.

To date, many studies have suggested the advantage of PR for microorganisms in sunlit environments. The ecophysiological significance of PR is still not fully understood however, including the drivers of PR gene gain, retention, and loss in different marine microbial species. To explore this question we sequenced 21 marine Flavobacteriia genomes of polyphyletic origin, which encompassed both PR-possessing as well as PR-lacking strains. Here, we show that the possession or alternatively the lack of PR genes reflects one of two fundamental adaptive strategies in marine bacteria. Specifically, while PR-possessing bacteria utilize light energy (“solar-panel strategy”), PR-lacking bacteria exclusively possess UV-screening pigment synthesis genes to avoid UV damage and would adapt to microaerobic environment (“parasol strategy”), which also helps explain why PR-possessing bacteria have smaller genomes than those of PR-lacking bacteria. Collectively, our results highlight the different strategies of dealing with light, DNA repair, and oxygen availability that relate to the presence or absence of PR phototrophy.","tags":[""],"title":"Solar-panel and parasol strategies shape the proteorhodopsin distribution pattern in marine Flavobacteriia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuu Hirose","Naomi Misawa","Chinatsu Yonekawa","Nobuyoshi Nagao","**Mai Watanabe**","Masahiko Ikeuchi","Toshihiko Eki"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"d6641d6c439745bdc53d80fd71f25b75","permalink":"https://.github.io/publication/hirose-2017-characterization/","publishdate":"2019-09-20T13:47:22.593819Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hirose-2017-characterization/","section":"publication","summary":"Certain cyanobacteria can adjust the wavelengths of light they absorb by remodeling their photosynthetic antenna complex phycobilisome via a process called chromatic acclimation (CA).

RNA sequencing analysis suggested that the length of phycoerythrin rods in each phycobilisome is strictly regulated by the green light and red light-sensing CcaS/R system, whereas the total number of phycobilisomes is governed by the excitation-balancing system between phycobilisomes and photosystems.

Although most genes encoding enzymes of the chlorophyll degradation pathway have been identified, the regulation of their activity has not been fully understood. Green cotyledon mutants in legume are stay-green mutants, in which chlorophyll degradation is impaired during leaf senescence and seed maturation. Among them, the soybean (*Glycine max*) green cotyledon gene *cytG* is unique because it is maternally inherited. To isolate *cytG*, we extensively sequenced the soybean chloroplast genome, and detected a 5-bp insertion causing a frame-shift in *psbM*, which encodes one of the small subunits of photosystem II. Mutant tobacco plants (*Nicotiana tabacum*) with a disrupted *psbM* generated using a chloroplast transformation technique had green senescent leaves, confirming that *cytG* encodes PsbM. The phenotype of *cytG* was very similar to that of mutant of chlorophyll *b* reductase catalyzing the first step of chlorophyll *b* degradation. In fact, chlorophyll *b*-degrading activity in dark-grown *cytG* and *psbM*-knockout seedlings was significantly lower than that of wild-type plants. Our results suggest that PsbM is a unique protein linking photosynthesis in presenescent leaves with chlorophyll degradation during leaf senescence and seed maturation.

This rod-shaped PBS includes phycocyanin (PC) and CpcG3 (hereafter renamed “CpcL”), but no allophycocyanin or CpcGs. Fluorescence excitation showed efficient energy transfer from PBS to PSI. The supercomplex was analyzed by electron microscopy and single-particle averaging. In the supercomplex, one to three rod-shaped CpcL–PBSs associate to a tetrameric PSI complex. They are mostly composed of two hexameric PC units and bind at the periphery of PSI, at the interfaces of two monomers. Structural modeling indicates, based on 2D projection maps, how the PsaI, PsaL, and PsaM subunits link PSI monomers into dimers and into a rhombically shaped tetramer or “pseudotetramer.” The 3D model further shows where PBSs associate with the large subunits PsaA and PsaB of PSI. It is proposed that the alternative form of CpcL–PBS is functional in harvesting energy in a wide number of cyanobacteria, partially to facilitate the involvement of PSI in nitrogen fixation.","tags":null,"title":"Attachment of phycobilisomes in an antenna--photosystem I supercomplex of cyanobacteria","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Koichi Hori","Fumito Maruyama","Takatomo Fujisawa","Tomoaki Togashi","Nozomi Yamamoto","Mitsunori Seo","Syusei Sato","Takuji Yamada","Hiroshi Mori","Naoyuki Tajima","Takashi Moriyama","Masahiko Ikeuchi","**Mai Watanabe**","Hajime Wada","Koichi Kobayashi","Masakazu Saito","Tatsuru Masuda","Yuko Sasaki-Sekimoto","Kiyoshi Mashiguchi","Koichiro Awai","Mie Shimojima","Shinji Masuda","Masako Iwai","Takashi Nobusawa","Takafumi Narise","Satoshi Kondo","Hikaru Saito","Ryoichi Sato","Masato Murakawa","Yuta Ihara","Yui Oshima-Yamada","Kinuka Ohtaka","Masanori Satoh","Kohei Sonobe","Midori Ishii","Ryosuke Ohtani","Miyu Kanamori-Sato","Rina Honoki","Daichi Miyazaki","Hitoshi Mochizuki","Jumpei Umetsu","Kouichi Higashi","Daisuke Shibata","Yuji Kamiya","Naoki Sato","Yasukazu Nakamura","Satoshi Tabata","Shigeru Ida","Ken Kurokawa","Hiroyuki Ohta"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"2f1ab0dcd3afbe8fe31abc0da05681f3","permalink":"https://.github.io/publication/hori-2014-klebsormidium/","publishdate":"2014-05-28T13:47:22.592167Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hori-2014-klebsormidium/","section":"publication","summary":"The colonization of land by plants was a key event in the evolution of life.

These skeleton-like structures may serve as a scaffold of the whole PBS assembly. Different roles of ApcC1 and ApcC2 were also suggested. Based on these findings, structural models for PBS were proposed.

In contrast to known cyanobacteria that produced the PSI trimer, a filamentous N2-fixing cyanobacterium *Anabaena* sp. PCC 7120 and a glaucocystophyte *Cyanophora paradoxa* NIES 547 had a PSI tetramer and dimer but no trimer at all. This was confirmed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. A primitive rhodophyte *Cyanidioschyzon merolae* had two species of PSI monomeric complex with a light-harvesting Chl complex of a different composition. These results are discussed with regard to the evolution of the PSI supercomplex.","tags":null,"title":"Novel supercomplex organization of photosystem I in Anabaena and Cyanophora paradoxa","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Mai Watanabe**","Masako Iwai","Rei Narikawa","Masahiko Ikeuchi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1230768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1230768000,"objectID":"be12e8d2b2b02766e66495b0f42f14eb","permalink":"https://.github.io/publication/watanabe-2009-photosystem/","publishdate":"2019-09-20T13:47:22.582818Z","relpermalink":"/publication/watanabe-2009-photosystem/","section":"publication","summary":"It is widely believed that the photosystem II (PSII) complex may function as a dimer in the thylakoid membrane. Here, we report experimental conversion from the monomeric PSII to the dimeric form by treatment with high concentrations of *n*-dodecyl-β-D-maltopyranoside (DM). The content of the PSII monomer in a PsbTc deletion mutant was much higher than in the wild type when solubilized with low concentrations of DM. However, upon treatment with higher concentrations of DM, the PSII dimer was also recovered in the PsbTc deletion mutant. These results suggest that there are at least two distinct processes of dimerization: (i) PsbTc dependent and (ii) DM induced. We discuss the results with regard to the native assembly form(s) of PSII.","tags":null,"title":"Is the photosystem II complex a monomer or a dimer?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yohei Ikeda","Masayuki Komura","**Mai Watanabe**","Chie Minami","Hiroyuki Koike","Shigeru Itoh","Yasuhiro Kashino","Kazuhiko Satoh"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1199145600,"objectID":"e90ea9250230e4c3ab0de96b832b2030","permalink":"https://.github.io/publication/ikeda-2008-photosystem/","publishdate":"2019-09-20T13:47:22.583817Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ikeda-2008-photosystem/","section":"publication","summary":"Diatoms occupy a key position as a primary producer in the global aquatic ecosystem. We developed methods to isolate highly intact thylakoid membranes and the photosystem I (PS I) complex from a marine centric diatom, *Chaetoceros gracilis*. The PS I reaction center (RC) was purified as a super complex with light-harvesting fucoxanthin-chlorophyll (Chl)-binding proteins (FCP). The super complex contained 224 Chl *a*, 22 Chl *c*, and 55 fucoxanthin molecules per RC. The apparent molecular mass of the purified FCP–PS I super complex (∼ 1000 kDa) indicated that the super complex was composed of a monomer of the PS I RC complex and about 25 copies of FCP. The complex contained menaquinone-4 as the secondary electron acceptor A1 instead of phylloquinone. Time-resolved fluorescence emission spectra at 77 K indicated that fast (16 ps) energy transfer from a Chl *a* band at 685 nm on FCP to Chls on the PS I RC complex occurs. The ratio of fucoxanthin to Chl *a* on the PS I-bound FCP was lower than that of weakly bound FCP, suggesting that PS I-bound FCP specifically functions as the mediator of energy transfer between weakly bound FCPs and the PS I RC.","tags":null,"title":"Photosystem I complexes associated with fucoxanthin-chlorophyll-binding proteins from a marine centric diatom, Chaetoceros gracilis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Mai Watanabe**","Yasuhiro Kashino","Kazuhiko Satoh","Hiroyuki Koike","Merope Tsimilli-Michael","Reto J Strasser"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1199145600,"objectID":"e5d4b5066abc59e9d87735ca73e1ba33","permalink":"https://.github.io/publication/watanabe-2008-reconstitution/","publishdate":"2019-09-20T13:47:22.588943Z","relpermalink":"/publication/watanabe-2008-reconstitution/","section":"publication","summary":"Cyanobacteria possess a high activity of cyclic electron transport (CET).
